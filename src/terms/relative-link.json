    "shortDefinition": "A hyperlink that includes only the address of the linked page that is relative to the linking page, rather than the full URL. \n\nA relative link needs the full URL of the current page to be resolved. Web browsers resolve relative links into full links before sending to a web server. Relative links frequently are used to reference web assets located in the same directory as the current asset. (Example: \"style.css\" is a relative link.)"
