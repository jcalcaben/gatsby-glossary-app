A library, or file bundle, that is obtained using Composer — an external software — and that provides functionality or fulfills a dependency. The content of the package contains PHP code, a name and a version that identify the package, as well as metadata. For installation, the source definition is the information that is most relevant — this describes where to get the package contents and any dependencies.
