A tag designed for Magento 2 software to enable simpler and more flexible user interface (UI) rendering.
The goals of the UI component system include the following:

* Simplifying Layout Handle XML files
* Moving Magento Admin user interface elements from HTML+Javascript to a “pure javascript” custom widget system
* Enabling the creation of more complex UI components out of smaller components
* Pre-rendering data for UI components as JSON, binding closely to Magento backend data objects
* Using AJAX to update component data
* Introducing a new DSL for creating all of the above
