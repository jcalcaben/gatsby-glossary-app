The company — "Magento" or "Magento, An Adobe Company" — includes several products in the following categories: digital commerce, order management, and other industry solutions. The Magento term is a registered trademark and a company name.

After the merger, Magento has become a part of [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com) in their [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/experience-cloud.html). See the Magento offering as [Adobe Commerce Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/commerce/magento.html).

And remember, [Magento](https://magento.com/) is the awesome eCommerce company. [Magneto](http://magentonotmagneto.com/) is a super villain. And [Magenta](https://www.pantone.com/color-finder/Process-Magenta-C) is a great color.
