PWA Studio uses Redux for development. Redux is a JavaScript library used for managing state in a web application.

It provides a global store object that holds application state that multiple components depend on. Components that plug into the store have direct access to the specific state data they need. This library is often paired with React to alleviate the problem of passing data down multiple component layers.
