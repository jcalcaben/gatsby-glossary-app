A unit of page output that renders some distinctive content – a piece of information, a user interface element – anything visually tangible for the end-user. Blocks are implemented and provided by modules. Blocks use templates to generate HTML. Examples of blocks include a category list, a mini cart, product tags, and product listing.

Dynamic blocks provide content based on logic, such as price rules.

Page Builder expands on the interactivity and creation of blocks and dynamic blocks.
